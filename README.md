# ToDo-List-with-JavaFX

This was my first time using git hub in a while, and I finally wanted to start using it to upload my projects for my resume.  There was an issue with pushing the my files to the repository which is why the commit messages are a bit odd.  This is my first project, a very scuffed Todo list application with full crud ability, learned from Udemy Tim Buchalka's Java Mastercourse.
